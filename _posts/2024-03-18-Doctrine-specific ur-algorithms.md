### Doctrine-specific ur-algorithms

###### Talk at [<Q>The Berkeley Seminar</Q>](https://topos.site/events/berkeley-seminar/#doctrine-specific-ur-algorithms) <br/> Topos Institute <br/> Berekely, California <br/> 18 March 2024

###### Abstract:

Various constructions of categories have a universal property
expressing the freeness/initiality of the construction within a
specific categorical doctrine. Expressed in an algorithmic framework,
it turns out that this universal property is in a certain sense a
doctrine-specific <Q>ur-algorithm</Q> from which various known categorical
constructions/algorithms (including spectral sequences of bicomplexes)
can be derived in a purely computational way. This can be viewed as a
categorical version of the Curry-Howard correspondence to extract
programs from proofs.
