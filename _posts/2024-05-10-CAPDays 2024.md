We are happy to announce CAP Days 2024

* Dates: 1-5 of July, 2024
* Venue: Université de Picardie Jules Verne in Amiens, France.
* Homepage: [https://homalg-project.github.io/capdays-2024/](https://homalg-project.github.io/capdays-2024/)

CAP (shorthand for Categories, Algorithms, Programming) is a software
project for algorithmic category theory written in GAP. It facilitates
both the realization of specific instances of categories and the
implementation of generic categorical algorithms.

The workshop is split into three kinds of activities:

1. Introductory talks about algorithmic category theory (ALCT), CAP as
a dialect of ALCT, and CompilerForCAP.

2. An explicit live show-case implementation of a category constructor and an explicit categorical tower.

3. Exercise sessions implementing categorical algorithms in CAP. Participants are also invited to implement their own work in CAP and we will be happy to provide help.

The workshop aims at mathematicians, physicists, and computer
scientists who want to learn about applications of algorithmic
category theory and how CAP can be used to structure implementations
in a categorical way.
