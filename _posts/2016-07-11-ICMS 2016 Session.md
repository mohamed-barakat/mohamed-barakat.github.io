### [ICMS 2016 Session](https://fingolfin.github.io/icms2016/) at [Zuse Institute Berlin](https://www.zib.de/)
#### July 11-14, 2016

## Aim and Scope

Homological algebra is a universal language with an established
presence in many fields of mathematics. The session will focus on
modern applications of computational homological methods to the
representation theory of groups and algebras. These methods range from
the computability of group, Lie algebra, and Hochschild cohomology to
the constructivity of Morita, tilting, and various other equivalences
of derived and differentially enriched categories. Such equivalences
also connect the representation theory to equivariant coherent sheaves
on varieties admitting a tilting object and hence to algebraic
geometry.
