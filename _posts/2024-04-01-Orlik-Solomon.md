title: Equivariant Orlik-Solomon algebra of a matroid

Our research group is member of the [DFG Special Priority Programme SPP 2458 "Combinatorial Synergies"](https://www.combinatorial-synergies.de/).

Our project has two intertwined goals: Compute the graded parts of
Orlik-Solomon algebras of geometric lattices together with its algebra
structure and generalise the Lehrer-Solomon conjecture, possibly
altering its statement, to other classes of arrangements and
nonrepresentable matroids.

For the first goal, a major strategy will be the exploitation of
equivariant structures under (subgroups of) the automorphism group G
of the underlying lattice of the Orlik-Solomon algebra.

For the second goal, reasonable classes of arrangements that allow
both for an inductive process and have nontrivial automorphism groups
are the class of inductively free arrangements and the larger class of
free arrangements. Among these classes are the class of Coxeter
arrangements and the larger classes of ideal subarrangements of Weyl
arrangements and of crystallographic arrangements, all of which
include arrangements with relatively large automorphism groups.

The need to combine both strategies naturally leads us to the use of
the category-theoretic language, both as a theoretical framework and
as an algorithmic machinery.

The results will be made accessible via an online database.
