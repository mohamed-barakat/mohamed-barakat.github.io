We would like to draw your attention to a workshop on the "Mathematics
of Quantum Information", to take place in March 2019 in Siegen
(Germany).

The idea of the workshop is the following: The connection between
quantum physics and information theory has posed new challenges at the
border between mathematics and physics. The workshop will bring
together experts from physics (entanglement theory, information
theory, many- body physics) with mathematicians (optimization,
multilinear algebra, Gröbner bases) in an informal manner. This should
allow many discussions and the mutual exchange of ideas.

The workshop will take place in Siegen (Germany) from March 18-21,
2019. For more information, the list of confirmed speakers, and
registration see:
