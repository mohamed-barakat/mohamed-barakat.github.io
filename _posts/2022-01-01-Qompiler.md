Our research group is part of a consortium to develop a quantum
software stack [funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic
Affairs and Climate
Action](https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Navigation/DE/ProgrammeProjekte/AktuelleTechnologieprogramme/Quanten_Computing/Projekte/Qompiler/qompiler.html). A
quantum algorithm is expressible as a parallel and sequential
composition of morphisms in a specific dagger compact closed category
*H*. one among several categorical doctrines supported by the software
project
[CAP](https://homalg-project.github.io/docs/CAP_project-based/),
[actively developed](https://homalg-project.github.io/statistics) by
our research group. Part of the project is the development of a
[domain specfic compiler for category
theory](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project/tree/master/CompilerForCAP#readme)
that can compile away the entire abstraction introduced by the
categorical language. The remaining optimization in the specific
category *H* will be performed using the *ZX*-calculus introduced by
Bob Coecke and Ross Duncan in 2008 and further developed by them and
several other scientists.
