### Workshop at the University of Siegen
##### February 13-16, 2023

The workshop aims at bringing together experts from Mathematics and
Physics to discuss the latest developments and future directions in
unraveling the Mathematical Structures in Feynman Integrals. Topics
will include among others Structures of Feynman integrals, Integral
reduction, Applications from algebraic geometry, Finite fields and
rational reconstruction, Differential equations, etc.

The program will feature dedicated talks, but will also leave ample
time for discussions among workshop participants.

February 11, 2023 marks the 100th anniversary of the death of the
mathematician Wilhelm Killing, born in Burbach, only 20km from
Siegen. Killing formulated a research program that is still relevant
today and has significantly influenced mathematical research for a
century. The 100th anniversary of Killing's death is an appropriate
opportunity to honour his merits with an inaugural talk by
[Prof. Wolfgang Hein](https://www.uni-siegen.de/fb6/phima/member/hein/vkhein.html).
