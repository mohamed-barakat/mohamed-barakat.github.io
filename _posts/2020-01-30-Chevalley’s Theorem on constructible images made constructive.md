### Chevalley’s Theorem on constructible images made constructive

Chevalley proved that the image of an algebraic morphism between
algebraic varieties is a constructible set. Examples are orbits of
algebraic group actions. A constructible set in a topological space is
a finite union of locally closed sets and a locally closed set is the
difference of two closed subsets. Simple examples show that even if
the source and target of the morphism are affine varieties the image
may neither be affine nor quasi-affine. In this talk, I will present a
Gröbner-basis-based algorithm that computes the constructible image of
a morphism of affine spaces, along with some applications.
