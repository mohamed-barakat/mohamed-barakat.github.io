### February 13-16, 2023
### University of Siegen

The workshop aims at bringing together experts from Mathematics and
Physics to discuss the latest developments and future directions in
unraveling the Mathematical Structures in Feynman Integrals. Topics
will include among others Structures of Feynman integrals, Integral
reduction, Applications from algebraic geometry, Finite fields and
rational reconstruction, Differential equations, etc.

The program will feature dedicated talks, but will also leave ample
time for discussions among workshop participants.
